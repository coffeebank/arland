#### Upgrading to SSL

--

From the Desk of Arland Staff,

Staying safe online is vital to ensuring a smooth and consistent experience. That's why we're proud to announce that, **effective immediately, all Arland website properties now have SSL enabled!**

SSL is a widely used network encryption protocol that ensures safety and security on the website you're visiting. Whether you're filling out a form or just clicking around, SSL means that your connection is private and encrypted. You can verify this by checking for a padlock icon on the top left corner of your browser, and for the "https" in front of the website link.
