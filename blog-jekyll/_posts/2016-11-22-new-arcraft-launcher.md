We are happy to announce that we now have our own Arcraft Launcher!

Running Arland via the Arcraft Launcher gives you access to even more features than playing via Minecraft Multiplayer.

You get:
- **New mods!** - Get all sorts of new goodies in our new Arworld map
- **More choice!** - Choose between normal Minecraft, normal Arland, or a new mod-filled Arworld
- **Play everything!** - Normal Minecraft is included, so play all your Minecraft straight from Arcraft Launcher

The Arcraft Launcher is free for everyone! Download the Arcraft Launcher here:
