Hello Arlanders!

We're proud to announce the [first release of Arland PWA to Beta](../index), built in collaboration with [@gitnisyl](https://github.com/gitnisyl/arland)! At version 0.180604, the app has completed its final phase of production, and all Arland web properties now redirect automatically to [Arland PWA](../index). ([What is a PWA/Progressive Web App?](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/))

The new Arland PWA is a huge revamp and redesign of Arland's main website, which was geared towards PC users only and left mobile users behind. Moving forward, creating a Progressive Web App will help reduce developmental overhead, decrease dependency on Weebly (whom has been ramping up their promotional banners recently), and not only increase cross-device compatibility, but also extend compatibility to older devices as well -- regardless of whether you're on PC or mobile, browsing from the latest iPhone or an outdated browser on your gaming console.

Over the next few months, we'll keep adding new features to the Arland PWA. On our current list of top priorities: auto-HTTPS redirection, live chat integration, offline caching capabilities, and an automatic "Add to Desktop" banner when visiting from mobile devices.

We look forward to your continued patronage as we look forward to entering into our second year of operations!

Thanks for playing,
