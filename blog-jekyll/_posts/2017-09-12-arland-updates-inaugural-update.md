#### Inaugural Update

--

Hello Arlanders,

October will mark our 1-year anniversary for Arland! We have gone very far in our journey, and we hope to continue this legacy.

First, we have several announcements to make:

1. *Shutting Down*{:.underline}
    - **â€‹All Arland Minecraft servers** will henceforth be down indefinitely
    - **Arland Discord** will no longer be available
2. *Maintenance Mode*{:.underline}
    - **Arland Website** will continue to exist in maintenance mode
    - **Arland App** will continue to exist in maintenance mode
    - **Arland Support Desk** will continue to be available at [fredpaletto+arland@gmail.com](../about)

While the servers will be taken down effective immediately, the website and App will remain as a steadfast beacon of hope that shines into the night sky. We will not be forgotten, and these properties will serve as a memoir of what Arland has been and what Arland can once again become in the future.

We deeply extend our thanks to all our donators that have helped to keep Arland alive. From this point on, we'll go into hiatus for the foreseeable future. If we ever decide to revive Arland, we'll be sure to update the blog to let you know!

<br>

As always, Thanks for playing,

@fredpaletto
