#### Project Deciduous, Budget Cuts

--

Hello Arlanders,

We are currently implementing **Project Deciduous** as a part of a series of cost-cutting measures. As we are low on funds, we would deeply appreciate it if you can donate to us so that we can keep the Arland server running

All changes listed below will affect all Arland players, effective immediately.

- **Arland will now be seasonal**  
Arland will now only operate during Summer and Winter Break (June-August, November-January), as that is when the majority of our players are available to play Arland. As such, we will be back online by June!  


- **Server Limit**  
Our new recommended server limit is 6 players. This means that when more than 6 players are online at the same time on Arland server, the server may start to lag significantly. If [Arland becomes more popular](../arlandw/share) or [we receive more donations](../arlandw/donate), we may consider raising this limit or improving server performance.  


- **Fixing Bugs and Errors**  
We are migrating some of our systems, which means some links may be broken. We're working to fix this, but for now, [you can report any errors you find to our Feedback form](../arlandw/gformfeedback) so we can fix it faster!  


We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause for our players, and we hope to find a balance between quality and sustainability in our continuing operations.

As always, thank you for playing Arland!
