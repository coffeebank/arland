There have been a few updates to the Arland site that we would like to announce.

The following has changed:

- **New Website Layout**  
The website redesign is now complete! 
- **Snow!!**  
A holiday special ;)
- **Donate Page**  
New "Contributors" section has been added!
- **Contact Us**  
New contact form with nicer layout. Also faster replies!

Our staff is working hard to make sure you can start playing Arland without any problems. If you do have anything you want to tell us, send a message to us [with our new Contact Form](../arlandw/contact.html)!

Thanks for playing,
