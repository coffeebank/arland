Hello Arlanders!

Long-time members of our service may recall our previous blog post about [Project Deciduous](20170513-arland-updates-project-deciduous-budget-cuts) in our mission to reduce operational costs while still providing a welcome area to explore. The project has been an extraordinary success in helping meet our players' needs while allowing us to run on an ultra-lean budget.

Moving forward, in order to continue to reduce overhead maintenance and labor hours necessary to upkeep Arland properties, we are now launching **Project Evergreen** as a way to move our products onto a path of long-term sustainability with minimal maintenance required. We are proud to say that these changes will require little to no changes on the part of our users.

All changes listed below will affect all Arland players, effective immediately.

- **Arland's new website will be at [gitnisyl.github.io/arland](../)**  
We are migrating away from [arland.pythonanywhere.com](../) and into Github as our domain in order to help streamline website updates and allow quicker information access. Website redirects will remain in place for 6 months, effective today, to help our users transition.  


- **Progressive Web App capabilities have been updated**  
The new Arland PWA is now fully offline-capable, supports HTTPS/SSL by default, and offers a slick new install experience for your homescreen!  


- **Unified API platform for new updates**  
All backend Arland web properties have now been updated to show the latest information direct from our Github repo, allowing us to only need to update one central location to update all web properties  


No changes are being made to the Arland Minecraft Server itself. For more information about the server, please contact [@onesc](../about).

We hope to continue serving you, our players, far into the future. Project Evergreen is our commitment to that goal.

Thanks for playing,
