There will be a major change to Arland servers effective immediately.

The following has changed:

- **Maximum players online at any time reduced**  
    (Unlimited -> 16)

- **Switched to slower servers**  
    (Players may start experiencing lag)

- **Switched server locations**  
    (US-LosAngeles to CA-Montreal)â€‹

These changes have been made as a result of cost-cutting measures. We may reverse these changes in the future if we receive more donations or during peak playing times later on in the year.

If you have any questions or concerns about any of the changes, feel free to contact us anytime via our contact form here. We apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused, and we hope you continue to enjoy Arland.


Sincerely,
