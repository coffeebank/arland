#### Back in town! Partnership with WSC

--

Hello Arlanders,

We're proud to announce that our temporary hiatus is now over! After a quick reorganizing of our systems, we are now back up and running!

A brief overview of what we've changed:

- **â€‹Arland by WSC** will be our new name! Now partnered with WSC.
- **Arland Minecraft Server** is now back up on the IP arland.ddns.net:26620 
- **Arland Discord Server** is now back up in WSC under #arland-mc

**Arland by WSC**  
Arland is now being generously sponsored by WSC (Work|Studying|Chilling)! As a part of our restructuring efforts in the past few months, we are excited to announce a partnership with WSC (Work|Studying|Chilling), a Discord server built around a studying and relaxing community of students! With WSC's resources, community, and support, Arland will continue on its mission to provide a fun, new, and unique experience on Minecraft!

**Arland Minecraft + Discord Server**  
The server is now back up and running in the IP listed above! In addition, the website will be getting a significant overhaul over the next few months, so stay tuned for the changes :) All new features -- including a link to the new Discord server and what has changed -- will be released in a new blog post soon.

<br>

We hope to see you back in Arland!
