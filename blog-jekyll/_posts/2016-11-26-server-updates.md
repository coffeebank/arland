There will be a major change to Arland servers effective immediately.

The following has changed:

- **Maximum players online at any time increased**  
(16 -> 32)
- **Switched to faster servers**  
(1.5GB -> 2GB RAM)

We have decided to improve our server with these changes for the upcoming holiday season. Depending on the amount of donations we receive, we may make our server even better and increase server capacity!
As usual, if you have any questions, [feel free to ask us with our Contact form here](../arlandw2/contact-us.html), or if you would like even more features, [give us some ideas here](../arlandw2/request-features.html)!


Thanks for playing,
